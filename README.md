## Toy 1:

Question = 

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

for this solution we have to:
    
    1. Identify the inputs and outputs to have a grasp at what needs to be declared and what needs to be the return value

    2. Our input is student marks and the output is the grade

    let studentMarks = `how many marks they got`

    3. In order to have the return value corresponding to the correct grades we will use the function element and if ... else if
